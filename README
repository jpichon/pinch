Pinch is a micro-blogging reader (with bits of writer to come later
on) for identi.ca written for the Maemo platform/N900.

The goal and general direction is to build a micro-blogging tool
optimised for reading: coping with large amounts of updates, being
able to easily catch up in sections when time is short, highlight
messages to deal with later (reply, URL to check out, ...), etc.

To run in Scratchbox:
* Make sure to have scratchbox installed [0] with the Python
  environment [1]
* Untar the source, then run:
  $ run-standalone.sh python2.5 src/base.py

To run on the N900:
* Make sure to have the Python environment installed [2]
* Untar the source, then from the command-line on the phone:
  $ python2.5 src/base.py

Debs to come later. Get in touch if you can't get it working, this is
very much a work in progress. This also happens to be my first Gtk
project, which means gremlins are surely lurking in the dark (feedback
and tips welcome!)
